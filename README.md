## Boombox TTS
Boombox is a mod that adds Microsoft Text-to-Speech voices to Lethal Company, allowing players without microphones to be heard!

### Notable Features
* Two voices, known as `david` and `zira`. Use the `!voice` command to select a voice! Example: `!voice david`
* Configurable silence prefix which will prevent the TTS from playing audio. By default, this prefix is `/`
* Using the `!voice` command with an invalid voice or `none` will disable your voice.

### Issues
* This mod only works on Windows OS. If Lethal Company arrives to Mac OS or Linux, this mod will not be able to support those operating systems.
* You must need the Microsoft voices installed on your computer to use all the voices. If these voices somehow haven't been bundled with your OS, you can find out how to install them [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/appendix-a-supported-languages-and-voices-4486e345-7730-53da-fcfe-55cc64300f01)
